The folder of "supporting_data" is for the data of the JGR_Biogeoscience manuscript.

1. Monthly outputs of GPP, evapotranspiration (ET), NEP, heterotrophic respiration (RH), autotrophic respiration (including growth and maintenance respirations, RVGRWTH and RVMAINT), soil evaporation (PESOIL), surface runoff (RUNOFFS),
   soil moisture for the upper and lower layers (SMOIST and SMOISTLL), and the soil organic carbon (SOLC) from TEM-HD 2L are included. These data were used to generate Figure 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the main text and Figure S7 in the 
   Supplementary Information.

2. Daily outputs of RH, RVGRWTH, and RVMAINT are include, which are used to generate Figure 9 in the main text. 

3. Monthly outputs of precipitation and temperature, which are also the input data of original climate dataset, are included. These data were used to generate Figure S6 and S8 in the Supplementary Information. 

4. Monthly outputs of the river discharge in the North Canadian Watershed were used to generate Figure S4 in the Supplementary Information. 

5. Monthly outputs of GPP and ET from TEM-HD 2L at the ARC and WLR sites were used to generate Figure 2 in the main text.
